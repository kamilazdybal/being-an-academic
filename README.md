## On academic writing

### On the writing craft in general

- [📄 *Dancing With Professors: The Trouble With Academic Prose*, Patricia Nelson Limerick](https://observer.com/2015/11/dancing-with-professors-the-trouble-with-academic-prose/)

↑ This one is pretty amusing, highly recommend 🙂

> *I do not believe that professors enforce a standard of dull writing on graduate students in order to be cruel. They demand dreariness because they think that dreariness is in the students’ best interests. Professors believe that a dull writing style is an academic survival skill because they think that is what editors want, both editors of academic journals and editors of university presses. What we have here is a chain of misinformation and misunderstanding, where everyone thinks that the other guy is the one who demands, dull, impersonal prose.*

- [📄 *How to Write a Thesis, According to Umberto Eco*, Umberto Eco](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/umberto-eco-how-to-write-a-thesis/)

> ***You are not Proust.** Do not write long sentences. If they come into your head, write them, but then break them down.*

### On writing journal publications

- [📄 *How to write the introduction of a scientific article*, Jorge Faber](https://www.jwfo.org/article/S2212-4438(12)00049-5/fulltext)

> *The rigidity and conciseness of scientific language should not be allowed to undermine the elegance of a text.*

- [📄 *Skillful writing of an awful research paper*, Royce Murray](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ac2000169)

> *(...) So these are a few simple rules for poor scientific writing. If you follow them faithfully and your paper is rejected or never cited, irrespective of your native brilliance, you have nonetheless been successful as a poor writer.*

- [📄 *How to write really good articles for premier academic journals*, Peter LaPlaca et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001985011730874X)


- [📄 *Research papers 101: The do’s and don'ts of scientific writing*, Daniel Torres-Valladares et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785320404262)


- [📄 *I’m writing a journal article – what literatures do I choose?*, Pat Thomson](https://patthomson.net/2020/01/27/im-writing-a-journal-article-what-literatures-do-i-choose/)
