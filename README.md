# On being an academic

This repository is a collection of resources (with links) to help you in your research and academic journey.
This collection has been curated from sources that I myself have read/watched and found useful.
For each item in the collection, I have selected one "notable quote" that I liked.

> *I do not believe that professors enforce a standard of dull writing on graduate students in order to be cruel. They demand dreariness because they think that dreariness is in the students’ best interests. Professors believe that a dull writing style is an academic survival skill because they think that is what editors want, both editors of academic journals and editors of university presses. What we have here is a chain of misinformation and misunderstanding, where everyone thinks that the other guy is the one who demands, dull, impersonal prose.*

## On scientific collaboration

- [📄 *The power of two: lessons from a scientific partnership*, Robert V. Farese Jr. et al.](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/145966)

> *Perhaps the most important task is finding a partner who shares your scientific values. 
> (...) Equally important as scientific compatibility is emotional compatibility. 
> Partners must have the capacity to handle challenging situations that arise in the relationship judiciously 
> and with empathy. 
> Finally, there is the chemistry between partners — that vital yet intangible quality of enjoying being around someone 
> with a compatible personality. 
> Thus, in pursuing a partnership, look for someone who fits your values, temperament, and personality.*

- [📄 *It takes two to think*, Itai Yanai & Martin J. Lercher](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-02074-2)

> *What is the deeper reason for the beneficial effects of talking with a trusted colleague on our creativity? 
> We speculate that there are underlying evolutionary reasons. 
> Humans are a social species who evolved to solve problems cooperatively rather than in isolation. 
> Improvisational discussions seem to be the hidden core ingredient of the creative scientific process, 
> and yet they are shrouded in misunderstandings. It often seems that the time investment 
> involved for such discussions hinders our progress, when in fact it advances it. 
> We may feel that we must grow out of these discussions once we become independent scientists, 
> when in fact they remain our most powerful tool for expanding our science into the unknown.*
